        1. Youth Hostel Movement was the brainchild of an eminent German Richard
        schirrman, who believed in the virtues of group excursions to study
        geography, history and the world of nature. He took delight in
        organizing weeklong trails for students. During an excursion in 1909,
        one night on 26th August, a terrible storing in thunder and lightning.
        While his young wards were fit fully asleep in one school premises.
        Richard lay awake pensively toying at the idea of utilizing the school
        building during holidays. It flashed to him that empty school rooms were
        waiting to be turned into dormitories and dining rooms. That fateful
        night marked the birth of the Youth Hostel Movement. Thus the first
        youth Hostel was opened in 1912 in Altena, Germany.

        2. In 1956, Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru summed up the philosophy of youth
        hostelling in a very precise manner, with that passion which
        characterized his love and concern for youth: I welcome the growth of
        the Youth Hostel Movement in India. Apart from the obvious advantages of
        travel in various parts of the country, there is, I think, a basic
        significance in men and women doing so in the impressionable. Years of
        their lives-, we have, even more, to get some idea of the great
        development schemes and the changes that are taking place in India. We
        have to do this not as tourists looking at strange objects but rather as
        children of India discovering our own country, with a desire to
        participate in the fashioning of India."

        4. In a vast country like India with its rich cultural heritage, there
        is great need to encourage Richard schirrman, scheme. The Indian Chapter
        of the Youth Hostel Scheme was initiated in 1949 when YHA of India was
        formed at Mysore. The Association built its own Youth Hostel at New
        Delhi in December 1977. The Government of India extended its support to
        the movement in 1966 when it decided to provide one model Youth Hostel
        for each State with its own funds during the Fourth and Fifth Five Year
        Plans. Later, a provision for 60 Youth Hostels was made in the Seventh
        Five Year Plan, which is being implemented by the Department of Youth
        Affairs, Government of India. Youth Hostel Jodhpur was started on 08.01.
        1993. At present, Youth Hostel has a total of 07 Air Cooled & 06 A.C.
        dormitories, 05 Air Cooled rooms, 12 A.C rooms and an auditorium of 250
        person's capacity. Total strength of Youth hostel jodhpur is 200 person.

        5. Acharya Narendra Dev's call that "the horizon of knowledge of our
        youth should expand in all dimensions" is reflected in YHAI's endeavors.
        Ram Manohar Lohia predicted that "a new endeavour of the Indian mind
        will then start which shall combine the rationale with the emotive,
        which shall make of unity in diversity not an inert but a vital doctrine
        which shall accept the clean joy of the sensible world without losing
        insight into the oneness for all life and things."

        6. Smt. Indira Gandhi once said: "Man is such a tiny creature in this
        vast universe. His conquests are those of imagination and will and
        endeavour. Man has a need to test strength to put himself against forces
        which are bigger than himself. Hence his search for a new world to
        conquer"

        1. In India the Youth Hostel movement was initiated by the Youth Hostels
        Association of India in 1949. Till 1966, the Association had created a
        number of simple youth hostelling facilities by using University /
        College Hostels during vacation
      </h2>
      <br />
      <h2>
        2. The Government scheme for constructing Youth Hostels was embarked
        upon by the Ministry of Education in the early sixties. With effect from
        4" January 1985, the subject was transferred to the Department of Youth
        Affairs and Sports. At present, while 82 Youth Hostels have already been
        constructed across the country, 2 more Youth Hostels are under various
        stages of construction
      </h2>
      <br />
      <h2>
        3. On the advice of the Planning Commission, a Central Committee on
        Youth Hostels was constituted in February 1962 This Committee outlined a
        programme for constructing four model youth hostels in Delhi, Mumbai,
        Madras and Kolkata and 10 similar youth hostels at places of historic
        and cultural interest. Under the aegis of the Ministry of Education
        however the scheme could not be implemented for some years. In 1963, the
        Youth Hostels Association of India also embarked upon a project to
        construct a Youth Hostel in the Diplomatic Enclave in New Delhi but it
        started functioning from 1977 only. In 1966 the responsibility of
        establishing Youth Hostels was transferred to the then Department of
        Tourism on the recommendation of a Working Group set by the Planning
        Commission in October 1965. The Department of Tourism implemented the
        scheme of constructing 17 Youth Hostels.
      </h2>
      <br />
      <h2>
        4. The construction of Youth Hostels is a joint venture of the Central
        and State Governments; As such the State Government makes available to
        the Central Government a fully developed plot of land, free of cost,
        measuring 1.5 to 2 acres, for construction of a Youth Hostel, keeping in
        view the various considerations that decide its suitability. In case of
        State Capitals, big Cities and hilly areas a fully developed plot of
        land measuring 0.75 to 1 acre may be considered as acceptable for the
        construction of Youth Hostel building. The State Government gives the
        land on lease to the Central Government for a period of 99 years on a
        nominal rent of Re. 1 per month. The Government of India constructs the
        Youth Hostel and the completed building is leased to the State
        Government for a period of.99 years on a nominal rent of Re. per month.
        Lease deeds, both for land and Hostel are executed by the parties. The
        land and the building are to be used as a Youth Hostel only and are not
        to be put to any other use. The ownership of Youth hostels would be
        vested with the Central Government i.e. Ministry of Youth Affairs &
        Sports, Department of Youth affairs.
      </h2>
      <br />
      <h2>
        5. In case suitable vacant plots are not available, the Government of
        India can resort to outright purchase of a suitable building with a
        spacious compound, without insisting on the size of the plot available.
